**Last updated: January 31, 2026**

## Your Privacy Matters

Still is designed with your privacy as a priority. We believe your personal wellness data should stay personal. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## What Data We Collect

Still collects and stores the following data locally on your device:

- Stress/calm moments you log (timestamps)
- Notes and tags you add to moments
- Your app preferences and settings
- Breathing exercise completion data

This data is stored only on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled).

## What We Don't Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:

- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics or behavior tracking
- Any data to third-party services

Still has no servers. Your data never leaves your device except to sync with your own iCloud account.

## iCloud Sync

If you have iCloud enabled, your Still data syncs across your devices using Apple's CloudKit. This sync is:

- End-to-end encrypted by Apple
- Accessible only to you
- Subject to Apple's privacy policy

You can disable iCloud sync in your device's Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud.

## Health Data

Still offers optional HealthKit integration. If enabled:

- Heart rate data is read to detect stress spikes
- Breathing sessions may be written as Mindful Minutes
- This data stays in Apple's Health ecosystem
- You control all permissions

HealthKit data is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Biometric Authentication

Still offers optional Face ID/Touch ID protection. Your biometric data is:

- Processed entirely by Apple's Secure Enclave
- Never accessed or stored by Still
- Used only to unlock the app locally

## Deleting Your Data

You have full control over your data:

- Delete individual moments from History
- Export all data as CSV anytime
- Uninstall the app to remove all local data
- Disable iCloud sync to stop cloud storage

We don't retain any data after you delete it.

## Policy Changes

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Significant changes will be communicated through app updates. Continued use of Still after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
